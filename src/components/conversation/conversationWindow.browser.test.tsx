  /*
   * Rendered evidence for the operator's complaint that a sent message passes
   * through a pile of visually different states before it settles.
   *
   * ONE page, one mounted conversation window — the production `LogFeed` and
   * `TmuxComposer` over the production outbox store — and a configurable fake
   * host behind them. The driver types into the real field, submits through
   * the path it is exercising, and then advances the host: a receipt lands,
   * the axes move, the transcript carries the message. Every frame it
   * photographs is a frame that ONE submission really reached, which is the
   * only way a transition can be observed at all. Pre-arranged snapshots of
   * each state, in a fresh context each, is what the previous round did, and
   * it is why a replaced node looked identical to an adopted one.
   *
   * What is written down, per frame: the bubble's painted width, opacity, type
   * size, padding and FULL position (both axes), the words beside the message,
   * the controls on it, and whether the row is still the very same DOM node —
   * marked on the first frame and looked for by that mark afterwards.
   *
   * The number the work is judged by is `distinctRenderings`: how many
   * different descriptions one ordinary message passes through between Send
   * and the transcript's own record of it. `evidence/message-row/
   * before-default-branch.json` is this same driver, unchanged, run against
   * the default branch over the ordinary send alone — which is how the before
   * and the after are the same measurement rather than two descriptions of
   * one. (Only the success scenario runs there: the affordance the other
   * scenarios disclose does not exist on that side.)
   *
   * Every scenario runs at a phone (with touch emulated, as a phone has) and a
   * desktop viewport, in both themes and both languages. Geometry goes to
   * `evidence/message-row/one-row.json`; frames to `.artifacts/message-row/`
   * and, so the operator can look at the pixels before merging, to
   * `/var/tmp/llv-message-row-evidence/`. Neither raster directory is
   * committed.
